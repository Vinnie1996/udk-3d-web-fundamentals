## Fundamentals of 3D animation for the web


In this course we will learn how to produce interactive 3D content for the web. 
The goal of the course is to give students the tools to create a video-game, an open space or a 3D animation that runs in the browser, can be self-hosted without the need for a social media platform, and can be shared with a link. We will only use open source tools such as Three.js and Blender. 
The course is aimed at beginners, some familiarity with variables, loops and arrays is recommended but not mandatory.
