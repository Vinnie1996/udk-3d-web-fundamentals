## Fundamentals of 3D animation for the web


In this course we will learn how to produce interactive 3D content for the web. 
The goal of the course is to give students the tools to create a video-game, an open space or a 3D animation that runs in the browser, can be self-hosted without the of a social media platform, and can be shared with a link. We will only use open source tools such as Three.js and Blender. 

The course is aimed at beginners, some familiarity with variables, loops and arrays is recommended but not mandatory.

*Maze*


*“I imagined a labyrinth of labyrinths, a maze of mazes, a twisting, turning, ever-widening labyrinth that contained both past and future and somehow implied the stars. Absorbed in those illusory imaginings, I forgot that I was a pursued man; I felt myself, for an indefinite while, the abstract perceiver of the world. The vague, living countryside, the moon, the remains of the day did their work in me; so did the gently downward road, which forestalled all possibility of weariness. The evening was near, yet infinite.”*
