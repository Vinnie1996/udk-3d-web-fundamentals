## Fundamentals of 3D animation for the web


The goal of the course is to give students the tools to create a video-game, an open space or a 3D animation that runs in the browser, can be self-hosted without the need of a social media platform, and can be shared with a link. Each student will develop its own game/animation, with the only constrain to create a link to the game/animation of another classmate.

We will only use open source tools such as Three.js and Blender. 

The course is aimed at beginners, some familiarity with variables, loops and arrays is recommended but not mandatory.

- How is the course structured
- How is the code structured


### 02

- Add light. Add more lights.
- Move things with sin(time) and cos(time). Unit Circle, wave, amplitude and frequence.
- Exercise in class. Take inspiration from one the abstract art of the beginning of the '900 and try to make a 3D composition.
